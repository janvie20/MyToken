MyToken Solidity Contract
Overview
This Solidity smart contract defines a basic token named "CONSTANT" with the abbreviation "CONST". The contract includes functionalities for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens, as well as maintaining a record of token balances for each address.

Contract Details
Public Variables
tokenName: The name of the token (set to "CONSTANT").
tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token (set to "CONST").
totalSupply: The total supply of the tokens (initially set to 0).
Mapping
balances: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.
Functions
mint
Increases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specific address.

Parameters:

_address (address): The address to which the tokens will be minted.
_value (uint): The number of tokens to be minted.
Functionality:

Increases totalSupply by _value.
Increases the balance of _address by _value.
burn
Decreases the total supply of tokens and the balance of a specific address.

Parameters:

_address (address): The address from which the tokens will be burned.
_value (uint): The number of tokens to be burned.
Functionality:

Checks if _address has a balance greater than or equal to _value.
If true, decreases totalSupply by _value.
Decreases the balance of _address by _value.
Usage
Deploy the Contract: Deploy the MyToken contract on a Solidity-compatible blockchain.
Mint Tokens: Call the mint function with the desired address and token amount to increase the total supply and the balance of the specified address.
Burn Tokens: Call the burn function with the desired address and token amount to decrease the total supply and the balance of the specified address, ensuring the address has enough tokens to burn.
Example
solidity
Copy code
// Deploy the contract
MyToken myToken = new MyToken();

// Mint 100 tokens to an address
myToken.mint(0x123..., 100);

// Burn 50 tokens from the same address
myToken.burn(0x123..., 50);
